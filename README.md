## Overview of Application
This is my first python web scraping application designed to pull information on your desired IRS forms or download available form based on year it was updated!

Future functionality will include:
 - Proccessing a base file instead of CLI inputs if desired.
 - Updating runner file logic for error handling
 - Potential GUI

## Techstack/Libraries

- Python 3.9.2
- BeautifulSoup
- lxml
- requests
- pprint
